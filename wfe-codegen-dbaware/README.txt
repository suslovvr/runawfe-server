This application analyzes PostgreSQL database structure and generates file wfe-core/src/main/java/ru/runa/wfe/commons/dbmigration/DbMigration0.java.
Re-run it on MASTER branch when number of migrations since last run grows large and empty database creation grows slow:

1. Create EMPTY PostgreSQL database.
2. Start WFE on it. WFE will: (a) populate it using current DbMigration0; (b) apply migrations created since DbMigration0 was generated.
3. Stop WFE.
4. Run ./build-n-run.sh <JDBC-URL-of-this-database>. It will regenerate DbMigration0 with current database structure and applied migration list.

NOTE 1. Running on MASTER branch is critical, since migrations in other branches are less stable and more likely to be edited, thus making
previously generated DbMigration0 incorrect.

NOTE 2. Running on EMPTY database in critical, since it gives deterministic result. Particularly, I edited Hibernate-generated random FK names
        in initial version of DbMigration0, and regenerating from some other non-empty DB will loose those edits.

NOTE 3. PostgreSQL's JDBC URL may contain username and password: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/wfe?user=yyy&password=zzz
