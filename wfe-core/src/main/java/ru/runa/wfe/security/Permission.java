/**
 * "Extensible enum": more "enum items" can be added elsewhere.
 * For example, if subproject needs additional permissions EXTRA_EXECUTOR_PERM and EXTRA_ACTOR_PERM
 * applicable to actors and groups, code it like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class ExtraPermission {
 *     public static final Permission EXTRA_EXECUTOR_PERM = new Permission("EXTRA_EXECUTOR_PERM");
 *     public static final Permission EXTRA_ACTOR_PERM = new Permission("EXTRA_ACTOR_PERM");
 *     static {
 *         // Declare which types new permissions are applicable to.
 *         ApplicablePermissions.add(SecuredObjectType.ACTOR, EXTRA_EXECUTOR_PERM, EXTRA_ACTOR_PERM);
 *         ApplicablePermissions.add(SecuredObjectType.GROUP, EXTRA_EXECUTOR_PERM);
 *
 *         // Declare that if EXTRA_ACTOR_PERM is requested on ACTOR, then it's sufficient to have
 *         // UDPATE permission on the same ACTOR instance, or ALL or UPDATE permission on EXECUTORS list.
 *         // Note 1: declare substitutions after declaring applicability.
 *         // Note 2: list type EXECUTORS is known from SecuredObjectType.ACTOR definition.
 *         // Note 3: lists's ALL is already a substitution for list's UPDATE, and list's UPDATE is already
 *         //         a substitution for instance's UDPATE (see PermissionSubstitutions static initialization),
 *         //         so .list() call can be omitted here.
 *         PermissionSubstitutions.add(SecuredObjectType.ACTOR, EXTRA_ACTOR_PERM)
 *                 .self(Permission.UPDATE)
 *                 .list(Permission.ALL, Permission.UPDATE);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * These permissions are pretty fine-grained. Some of them are as hidden (globally or for specific object types),
 * i.e. used internally but not editable by user. See method {@link ApplicablePermissions.DSL#hidden(Permission...)}
 * for details.
 * <p>
 * <b>ATTENTION!!!</b> Since once initialization completes, permissions are accessed as read-only,
 * no synchronization is done on internal structures to avoid unnecessary performance overhead.
 * So you MUST initialize permissions in single thread. Make sure that all classes that perform
 * this initialization (Permission itself and, considering example above, ExtraPermission)
 * are touched by class-loader in main thread during application startup.
 *

 * @see ApplicablePermissions
 * @see PermissionSubstitutions
